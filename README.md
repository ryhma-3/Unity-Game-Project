## About The Project
This project is a two dimensional role playing game(RPG). It was created using the Unity game engine and various free assets. Our goal was to create a fun and story rich game while familiarizing ourselves with Unity and honing our project-management and cooperation skills.   

The objective of the game is to defeat all of the bosses on the map. The player may choose the order in which he defeats them freely. Deaths are permanent, so vigilance is required. Detailed description of controls and game mechanics may be found in the main menu. 

## Getting Started

The game will be published on [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/) once we have determined that it is in a publishable state. Once the game is uploaded on Unity Play, 
we will add a link to this readme file. At this point the game is only playable through Unity-Hub.
