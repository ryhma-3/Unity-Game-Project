## Getting Started

The game will be published on [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/) once we have determined that it is in a publishable state. Once the game is uploaded on Unity Play, 
we will add a link to this readme file. At this point the game is only playable through Unity-Hub. 

## About The Project
This project is a two dimensional role playing game(RPG). It was created using the Unity game engine and various free assets. Our goal was to create a fun and story rich game while familiarizing ourselves with Unity and honing our project-management and cooperation skills.
